Your employer likely shares important details about your employment, including your title, job duration, and wages, with third party credit agencies to fulfill these requests. Unfortunately, this process is not transparent for employees and can be slow and error-prone for employers and verifiers.Truework is building a modern, consent-driven employment and income verification platform to give employees visibility and control into how their employment information is shared with others. We are growing quickly and currently handle thousands of verifications every month, which has enabled the approval of billions of dollars in loans and helps employees in regulated professions (e.g. nursing) start work more quickly than before.\nOur engineering team is still small, which means you’ll play big a part in shaping the future of Truework, and your work will have a significant impact and visibility. We leverage Django and React (Typescript), our infrastructure runs on AWS.

Why? Simply because aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases we know of – cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, even COVID-19 (see our recent work on this in [1] below). By understanding and treating the biological damage accumulated as we age, we can find powerful new therapies for fighting disease and living not only longer, but healthier lives.Over the past few decades, an unignorable amount of evidence has piled up from the best labs in the world showing that this is possible [2]. However, the research, while promising, has been frustratingly slow. We’re leveraging the power of machine learning to dramatically improve the experimental process and we believe this approach has the potential to unlock a whole new class of therapeutic discoveries.We have deep support from top-notch investors, including General Catalyst, First Round, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, Felicis, Caffeinated Capital, Sam Altman, and more.
